            <h1>Conference Code of Conduct</h1>

            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to
                agree with the
                following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.
                We are
                expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for
                everybody.</p>

            <p><em>tl;dr: Don&#39;t be a jerk</em></p>

            <h2>Need Help?</h2>

            <p>Gergely Nemeth <a href="tel:00-36-30-9-261-231">00-36-30-9-261-231</a> <a

            <h2>The Quick Version</h2>

            <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
                everyone,
                regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
                size, race,
                or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference
                participants in any
                form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
                including talks,
                workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
                violating these
                rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at
                the
                discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

            <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual
                orientation,
                disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public
                spaces,
                deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
                sustained
                disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
                sexual
                attention.</p>

            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
                immediately.</p>

            <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors
                should not use
                sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
                should not
                use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised
                environment.</p>

            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take
                any action
                they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
                conference with no
                refund.</p>

            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
                other
                concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff
                can be
                identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>

            <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or
                local law
                enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
                feel safe for
                the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

            <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and
                conference-related social events.</p>
